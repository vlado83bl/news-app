# news-app
Simple news app, containing login and logout functionality, CRUD functionality connected through firestore backend service. Also, form validation when adding the news is enabled, as well as search/filter functionality.
Useful project for junior/medior developers, with good practices for usage of Vue3.js composition API's, composable and reusable js functions that can be implemented in barely any project, as well with all the latest features from firestore.
